# Tic-tac-toe Project
This project is to demonstrate new capabilities of object based JavaScript code.

## Reflection
I am truly understanding the need to write psuedocode and comment code so to not make it overwhelming. Additionally, with this being the first time to truly implement UI with console code, I now have a better understanding on how to segment the code to be used by the UI without making the UI code turn into the Main Code. Furthermore, when writing some of the classes, I failed to properly encapsulate and decouple the code. Unfortunately, I have decided to end this project and to ensure the next time there will be a complete overview of tasks and classes/methods needed before coding.
